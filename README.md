# startngcv
Kazeem's cv made with html, css and javascript.

Javascript was used in this CV to display the contact form inside a modal box by clicking on the "Contact me" button. It was used for the form validations as well.
The validation was programmed in such a way that if the required parameters of a field is not filled, all other input fields as well as the submit button will be disabled until the error has been corrected.

The following validations were done:
1. The name must not be less than 4 characters
2. The email must be in the correct format. (Checks were made to detect if either the "@" or "." Symbol is missing so the appropriate error message can be given).
3. The message must not be less than 20 characters.
4. It is programmed to automatically choose between daylight and night mode display. (Day light mode is from morning to 7pm while night mode starts from 7pm).
